# BigData-MapReduceinPython
Write MapReduce programs in Python 

PART1: use DataA1.csv, with 2 py files to solve different MapReduce problems.
Data in DataA1.csv:
- rows are orders
- first column = Customer ID
- second column = Item ID
- third column = Amount Spend on the Order
Note that Customer ID and Item ID repeat. 

SpentByCustomer.py:
Is created to calculate the total amount spent by customer. This code also generates output in a text file.

SpentByCustomerOrder.py:
Is created to sort the Total Amount spent by customer, sort by amount spent ASC. This code will generate output in a text file. 

Note: for the two .py files above, make sure only run the last line, which is a comment.
